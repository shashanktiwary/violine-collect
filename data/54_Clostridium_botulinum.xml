		<pathogenesis refs="reference101">The botulinum neurotoxin is a metalloproteinase that enters nerve cells and blocks neurotransmitter release by zinc-dependent cleavage of protein components of the neuroexocytosis apparatus. Specifically, botulinum toxin types A and E target a protein known as SNAP-25, and toxin types B, D, F, and G target the protein VAMP/synaptobrevin. Toxin C targets both SNAP-25 and syntaxin. Target protein cleavage significantly disrupts release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. In its native state, this neurotoxin is bound to nontoxic proteins, which greatly enhances toxin molecular stability. Botulinum toxin introduced into the body (potentially by a number of mechanisms but most commonly by absorption from the gastrointestinal tract) is carried throughout the body by the bloodstream. Toxin binds to nerve-ending receptors, becomes internalized within the neuron, and causes an irreversible blockade of cholinergic transmission at the following sites: all ganglionic synapses, all postganglionic parasympathetic synapses, and all neuromuscular junctions. The far-reaching results at these sites include widespread flaccid paralysis and potentially devastating autonomic nervous system perturbations (PathPort).</pathogenesis>

Protective antibody immune response against specific BoNT toxin types is required to protect against different BoNT toxin types in botulism infections.  The administration of antitoxin is the only specific pharmacologic treatment available for botulism (Byrne et al., 2000).</protective_immunity>
		<host_range refs="reference101">The following animal models have been established:  binding of the progenitor toxins and recombinant proteins to human erythrocytes, binding experiments of the progenitor toxins and recombinant proteins to paraformaldehyde-fixed sections of guinea pig upper small intestine, wound botulism in mice using an inoculum of Clostridium botulinum type A spores, a rat model of localized disuse induced by the Clostridium botulinum toxin,  and the rat as an animal model for infant botulism (PathPort).</host_range>
		<introduction refs="reference101">The threat posed by botulism, classically a food- and waterborne disease with a high morbidity and mortality, has increased exponentially in an age of bioterrorism. Because botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) could be easily disseminated by terrorists using an aerosol or could be used to contaminate the food or water supply, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has classified it as a category A agent. In 1895, a botulism outbreak after a funeral dinner with smoked ham in the small Belgian village of Ellezelles led to the discovery of the pathogen Clostridium botulinum by Emile Pierre van Ermengem, Professor of bacteriology at the University of Ghent. The bacterium was so called because of its pathological association with the sausages (Latin word for sausage - &quot;botulus&quot;) and not-as it was suggested-because of its shape. Modern botulinum toxin treatment was pioneered by Alan B. Scott and Edward J. Schantz. Over 100 years ago, the classic food-borne type was found to be caused by ingesting contaminated food containing the toxin produced by a bacteria. In the first half of the 20th century a second form, wound botulism, was discovered. Three additional forms (infant, hidden, and inadvertent) were first described in the last quarter of the 20th century. Botulism is today divided into 5 clinical forms: classic or food-borne botulism, infant botulism, wound botulism, hidden botulism, and inadvertent botulism. BoNTs are serologically differentiated according to their neutralization with type-specific antitoxins into seven serotypes, designated by the letters A through G. Based on the toxin type produced, C. botulinum strains are divided in groups I to IV, with groups I and II being the main human pathogens. Group I consists of proteolytic types A, B, and F, and group II consists of nonproteolytic types B, E, and F. The two groups are completely different in their phenotypical characteristics, such as temperature requirements, biochemical profile, and production of metabolites. Types C and D provoke botulism in animal species, including the avian form. All eight neurotoxins (BoNT/A to BoNT/G and TeTx (tetanus toxin)) are synthesized as a single-chain, 150,000 Da molecule which subsequently becomes nicked to the more potent dichain form, composed of a heavy (H) (approximately 100,000 Da) chain and a light (L) (50,000 Da) chain polypeptide linked by at least one disulfide bridge (PathPort). </introduction>

		<description refs="reference107">The botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) are the causative agents of botulism and represent a family of seven structurally similar but antigenically distinct serotypes (A to G). These toxins exert their action by blocking release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. BoNT are usually expressed in as a single polypeptide chain and then post-translationally nicked, forming a dichain consisting of a 100-kDa heavy chain and a 50-kDa light chain held together by a single disulfide bond. Topologically, these neurotoxins are composed of three domains: binding, translocation, and catalytic, each of which is believed to play a role in intoxication. The carboxy-terminal portion of the heavy chain is responsible for binding nerve cell receptor(s). After toxin binding, it is thought to be internalized into an endosome through receptor-mediated endocytosis. It is believed that the 50-kDa amino-terminal domain of the heavy chain possesses channel-forming capabilities when in the acidic environment of the endosome, allowing internalization of the toxin. The final step in the mechanism involves zinc-dependent proteolysis by the catalytic domain of key cytosolic substrates necessary for neurotransmitter release (Byrne et al., 1998). </description>

			<description refs="reference107">Inhibition of BoNT action at a key step of the process could abolish the onset of botulism. One approach to developing a vaccine against botulism would be to construct and express a gene encoding only the binding domain of BoNT [BoNT(Hc)] and purify the translated product. This material, when administered to an organism, would not cause botulism because it lacks the enzyme and should not be able to enter the nerve cell without the translocation domain. Antibodies toward the product which neutralize BoNT serotype A (BoNT/A) toxicity when the host is directly challenged could be produced. Currently, a toxoid vaccine against BoNT serotypes A to E is used. However, there are inherent problems with the toxoid. The product consists of a crude extract of clostridial proteins. The material is dangerous to produce, and there is a high cost associated with preparing the toxoid vaccine. The toxoid also contains formalin, which is very painful for the recipient. Finally, only five of the seven serotypes are represented in the formulation. Thus, the aim of the present work was to develop a process for isolating a highly immunogenic recombinant BoNT(Hc) which could protect animals against a direct challenge of BoNT and that would be cheaper and less dangerous to produce. Ultimately, the developed process will be licensed as a vaccine (Byrne et al., 1998).</description>

		<description refs="reference110">Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) are a group of seven (A–G) antigenically distinct proteins produced by Clostridium botulinum, a gram-positive, spore-forming, obligate anaerobic bacillus found in soil and marine sediments from all parts of the world. BoNTs inhibit the release of acetylcholine (ACH) at the synapse of motor neurons, which initially causes muscle weakness, progressing to flaccid paralysis, subsequent ventilatory failure, and death. This can happen at very low concentrations of BoNT (10−9 g/kg), making the toxin one of the most potent poisons known.The most common exposures to BoNT are food-borne, infant, and wound botulism. The likely mode of delivery of BoNT in bio-warfare or terrorist scenarios is through aerosol delivery. Toxicity from BoNT can be lethal without early detection and intensive supportive therapy. Trivalent equine-based antitoxins (A, B, and E) are available and are used clinically to neutralize and clear BoNT from the circulatory system. A number of different products have been proposed as candidate vaccines against BoNT. For BoNT to express its deleterious effects, sequential mechanistic events are carried out by three discrete structural domains of the protein. The BoNT exert toxicity only after they bind specifically to a neuron receptor at the neuromuscular junction. This receptor-toxin complex is then internalized within a vesicle followed by translocation of a portion of the toxin into the neuronal cytosol. This part of the molecule is responsible for the inherent toxicity that arises from its endoprotease activity on neurovesicle transport proteins. Once enzymatically inactivated by the toxin, these &quot;SNARE&quot; proteins cannot facilitate ACH-containing neurovesicles docking to the plasma membrane at the neuromuscular junction. This inhibits the vesicle from expelling its contents (ACH) into the synaptic space. The different toxin events are brought about by distinct protein domains of the holotoxin that are nearly equal in mass, which have been structurally and functionally defined. The holotoxin, approximately 150 kDa, consists of a heavy chain (approximately 100 kDa) that extends from the carboxy terminus to a disulfide bridge where the light chain (approximately 50 kDa) is attached. The receptor-binding domain is found in the carboxy portion of the heavy chain known as the C fragment or HC region. The remaining fragment of the heavy chain is known as the HN and, with the carboxy terminus of the light chain, spans the disulfide bridge to comprise the translocation domain, which facilitates light-chain entry into the neuronal cytoplasm. The light chain contains the zinc-dependent endoprotease domain responsible for inactivating docking proteins, inhibiting exocytosis, and the inherent toxicity of BoNT. Because BoNT toxicity is neuro-specific and enzymatic, while substrate is limited, relatively few molecules of BoNT are necessary to inhibit neurovesicle docking and expulsion. A number of regions of the BoNT have been investigated and cloned for potential use as immunogens for recombinant vaccine candidates A and B serotypes. The C fragment of BoNT was a logical choice for a vaccine candidate based on its native function, immunogenicity, and lack of observed signs of toxicity (Boles et al., 2006).</description>

		<description refs="reference133">Botulism, caused by Clostridium botulinum type C, is one of the most important diseases of wild waterfowl. During outbreaks, management usually consists of collection and disposal of sick and dead birds to reduce the amount of carcass material that can act as substrate for further toxin production. Immunization might be used to reduce the risk of re-intoxication in treated waterfowl. Immunization has been used to protect
pheasants (Phasianus colchicus), broiler chickens, and other birds (Martinez et al., 1999).</description>

			<vaccination_protocol refs="reference133">Three separate trials were conducted. In Trial I, 60 adult male mallards were divided randomly into two groups of 30. Each bird in the immunized group was injected on the dorsum of the lower neck with 1 ml of vaccine. The 30 control birds were injected with 1 ml of sterile 0.85% saline at the same site. On days 5, 10 and 15 post-immunization, a sub-group of 10 immunized birds and a subgroup of 10 control birds were moved to a separate room and each bird was given approximately 4.5 x 10^4 mouse lethal doses (MLD50) of type C botulinum toxin by gastric intubation. The birds were then observed several times each day. Clinical signs of botulism were recorded as Stage I (bird is able to walk but has paresis or ataxia), Stage II (bird has difficulty walking, often using the wings to assist, but is able to evade capture and can reach food and water), or Stage III (bird is prostrate and paralyzed). Birds in Stage III were euthanized by overexposure to anaesthetic, and a necropsy was performed (Martinez et al., 1999).</vaccination_protocol>

		<virulence refs="reference109">Even though toxoid vaccines are available, there are numerous shortcomings with their current use and ease of production.  First, because C. botulinum is a spore-former, a dedicated facility is required to manufacture a toxin-based product.  The requirement for a dedicated manufacturing facility is not trivial.  It is extremely costly to renovate and upgrade an existing facility or to build a new one and then to maintain the facility in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) to manufacture one vaccine.  Second, the yields of toxin production from C. botulinum are relatively low.  Third, the toxoid-producing process involves handling large quantities of toxin and thus is dangerous, and the added safety precautions increase the cost of manufacturing.  Fourth, the toxoid product for types A-E consists of a crude extract of clostridial proteins that may influence immunogenicity or reactivity of the vaccine, and the type F toxoid is only partially purified (IND 5077).  Fifth, because the toxoid-producing process involves the use of formaldehyde, which inactivates the toxin, and residual levels of formaldehyde (not to exceed 0.02%) are part of the product formulation to prevent reactivation of the toxin, the vaccine is reactogenic.  An additional component of the toxoid vaccines is the preservative thimerosal (0.01%), which also increases the reactogenicity of the product ( Byrne et al., 2000).</virulence>
		<preparation refs="reference109">The vaccine batch no. 002/90 was derived from pooling three production lots of C. botulinum F toxin.  The harvested toxin (i.e. by acid precipitation, tangential flow filtration, and centrifugation) from each of three fermentation runs was pooled and the type F toxin extracted with sodium phosphate buffer (PBS).  After ribonuclease treatment, the toxin was further purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, and repeated fractionation on fast liquid column chromatography on a fast flow Q Sepharose column.  Unlike the toxoid (estimated toxoid purity of 10%), the purity of the type F botulinum toxoid Lot no. 002/90 was greater than 60% (IND 5077).  The partially purified F toxin was formalin-detoxified and adsorbed to adjuvant ( Byrne et al., 2000).</preparation>

			<description refs="reference124">A vaccine consisting of inactivated C. botulinum culture supernatants has been produced to provide military personnel with protection against BoNTs A, B, C, D and E.  However, disadvantages associated with this vaccine include its expense and requirement for frequent boosters to maintain protection, as well as its efficacy against only 5 of the 7 BoNT types.  Thus, new generation botulinum vaccines are being investigated, including the use of non-toxic BoNT Hc fragments as antigens.  More recently, DNA vaccines encoding BoNT/A Hc and type F botulinum neurotoxin Hc fragment (BoNT/F Hc) have been evaluated as candidate next generation botulism vaccines.  Such DNA vaccines may be optimized in terms of the regulatory elements used to drive expression of BoNT Hc (Jathoul et al., 2004).</description>

			<description refs="reference127">Vaccination with DNA encoding the Hc domain of botulinum neurotoxin subtype A has been attempted but had limited success; thus a clinically viable DNA vaccine for subtype A was not achieved. BoNT F is serologically distinct from A and the amino acid sequences of type F toxins from different strains of Clostridia fall into a distinct phylogenetic group. Type F toxin cleaves VAMP (vesicle associated membrane protein), whereas BoNT A cleaves SNAP-25. Protection in a murine model has been previously achieved using purified FHc which had been obtained from cultures of recombinant Escherichia coli and recombinant Pichia pastoris. FHc was also expressed in a Salmonella vector and achieved protection against intoxication in a murine model. Therefore, BoNT F could constitute a good candidate for DNA vaccination.

		<description refs="reference109">Currently, a pentavalent botulinum toxoid (PBT) against serotypes A-E is used to immunize specific populations of at-risk individuals. The manufacture of PBT, by the Michigan Department of Public Health (MDPH), took place in stages and over many years. The fermentation, isolation, purification and detoxification steps for each serotype took place in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The monovalent bulks were completed in 1971, and first packaged in 1978. Investigational New Drug (IND) status was granted for the PBT under the CDC's IND 161 (at risk workers) and under the United States Army's Office of Surgeon General IND 3723 (for military deployment). The MDPH product was studied and used as an investigational vaccine from 1979 until the present time.
An effort is ongoing on the part of the US Army to obtain Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure for the PBT lots PBP003 and PBP004. For licensure of the PBT, FDA required that a pivotal clinical trial be performed to re-evaluate safety and assess immunogenicity of the toxoid,and that a new lot of toxoid be manufactured to demonstrate reproducibility and robustness of the manufacturing process and consistency of the manufactured product. The final report on the pivotal clinical study was expected in June 2000. This study will have evaluated, in a significant number of participants, the protective immunogenicity of all 5 serotype vaccines with respect to their homologous neurotoxins. Results from this pivotal study and the status of a new-generation, recombinant vaccine will be factors in deciding whether to proceed with a new lot of toxoid ( Byrne et al., 2000).</description>

		<virulence refs="reference109">Even though toxoid vaccines are available, there are numerous shortcomings with their current use and ease of production. First, because C. botulinum is a spore-former, a dedicated facility is required to manufacture a toxin-based product. The requirement for a dedicated manufacturing facility is not trivial. It is extremely costly to renovate and upgrade an existing facility or to build a new one and then to maintain the facility in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) to manufacture one vaccine. Second, the yields of toxin production from C. botulinum are relatively low. Third, the toxoiding process involves handling large quantities of toxin and thus is dangerous, and the added safety precautions increase the cost of manufacturing. Fourth, the toxoid product for types A-E consists of a crude extract of clostridial proteins that may influence immunogenicity or reactivity of the vaccine, and the type F toxoid is only partially purified (IND 5077). Fifth, because the toxoiding process involves the use of formaldehyde, which inactivates the toxin, and residual levels of formaldehyde (not to exceed 0.02%) are part of the product formulation to prevent reactivation of the toxin, the vaccine is reactogenic. An additional component of the toxoid vaccines is the preservative thimerosal (0.01%), which also increases the reactogenicity of the product ( Byrne et al., 2000).</virulence>
		<preparation refs="reference109">The toxoid was manufactured by initially culturing C. botulinum serotypes A-E to produce crude preparations of neurotoxins. The toxins were separated from the culture fluid by acid precipitation overnight in the cold then separated from the supernatant fluid by filtration and/or centrifugation. The precipitated toxin was washed, extracted, and filtered to remove any particulate material.  Toxins were again precipitated, filter-sterilized, and detoxified by adding formalin. Residual formalin was left in the vaccine products to ensure that the neurotoxins remained non-toxic. Monovalent vaccines were then adsorbed to the adjuvant and blended into a pentavalent vaccine ( Byrne et al., 2000).</preparation>

The initial booster is given 12 months after the first immunization of the primary series, and additional boosters are administered annually (Byrne et al., 2000).</vaccination_protocol>
			<persistence refs="reference109">Immunological response indicated that 61 to 83% of the study subjects met the criteria for a booster dose at 1 year because of their low antitoxin levels (i.e. &lt; 0.10 IU/mL) at 6 months. One hundred percent of the subjects boosted at 1 year developed high concentrations of protective antitoxin by day 56 post-boost, and protective levels (≥ 0.02 IU/mL) persisted for at least 360 days in all subjects (Byrne et al., 2000).</persistence>

Just before the first annual booster, 10/21 (48%) and 14/21 (67%) people lacked a detectable titer for type A and for type B, respectively. After the first booster, all individuals tested had a demonstrable titer to both types A and B.

Formulations consisted of individual Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus replicon-vectored vaccines against a bacterial disease (anthrax), a viral disease (Marburg fever), and a toxin-mediated disease (botulism). The individual VEE replicon particles (VRP) expressed mature 83-kDa protective antigen (MAT-PA) from Bacillus anthracis, the glycoprotein (GP) from Marburg virus (MBGV), or the H(C) fragment from botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT H(C)) ( Lee et al., 2006).</description>

CBA/J mice were challenged s.c. on d 105 with 10 LD50 units (2 × 10^8 spores) of heat-shocked spores of the Sterne strain of B. anthracis. Positive control mice were inoculated with 0.1 ml of anthrax vaccine adsorbed (AVA, Bioport Corp., Lansing, MI) or with 0.1 ml of pentavalent botulinum toxoid vaccine, and negative control mice were inoculated with mSEB VRP, and all were used as controls for the challenges.

CBA/J mice inoculated with BoNT/A HC VRP were 90% protected from a BoNT/A challenge, whereas a mix of BoNT/A HC and MAT-PA VRP poorly protected the animals (2/10 survived) from the same BoNT/A challenge ( Lee et al., 2006).</protection_efficacy>

In response, current studies involve a multiagent vaccine that utilizes the VEE virus replicon as a vector for BoNT, anthrax, and MBGV, all of which are classified as category A pathogens ( Lee et al., 2006).</description>

        <phi_annotation>The DNA replicon vaccine (pSCARSBHc) encoding the Hc domain of BoNT/B (BHc) induced better responses and protection against BoNT/B mouse challenge than conventional DNA vaccine.  Recombinant SFV particle VRP-BHc protected mice from high-dose BoNT/B challenge [Ref1071:Yu et al., 2009].
The production of ciBoNT/B1 HP, ciBoNT/C1 HP, ciBoNT/E1 HP and ciBoNT/F1 HP suggest the ciBoNT HP vaccines exhibit superior potency after single vaccinations.[Ref4727:Webb et al., 2017]</phi_annotation>
