		<pathogenesis refs="reference150 reference151 reference152 reference134">Smallpox is a viral disease unique to humans. To sustain itself, the virus must pass from person to person in a continuing chain of infection and is spread by inhalation of air droplets or aerosols. There are three principal routes of viral infection corresponding to the three principal surfaces of the body: the respiratory tract, the alimentary tract, and the skin. Minor routes of infection include the urinary and genital tracts and the conjunctiva. Although congenital infection occasionally occurred in smallpox, it was of no epidemiologic importance. The infectious dose is unknown but is believed to be only a few virions (Henderson, 1999).
It is assumed to be low, 10 to 100 organisms (Franz et al., 1997). 
Variola is most effectively spread via the respiratory route with as little as ten plaque-forming units contained within aerosolized saliva able to transmit the infection from person to person (Hassett, 2003).
Variola virus is highly stable and retains its infectivity for long periods outside the host. It is infectious by aerosol, but natural airborne spread to other than close contacts is controversial. Approximately 30% of susceptible contacts became infected during the era of endemic smallpox, and the WHO eradication campaign was predicated on close person-to-person proximity being required for transmission to occur reliably. Nevertheless, variola virus's potential in low relative humidity for airborne dissemination was alarming in two hospital outbreaks. On natural exposure to aerosolized virus, variola travels from the upper or the lower respiratory tract to regional lymph nodes, where it replicates and gives rise to viremia, which is followed soon thereafter by a rash (PathPort).</pathogenesis>

		<protective_immunity refs="reference182">Both cellular and humoral immune response are important in protection against smallpox. In mouse models of vaccinia infection, extensive studies have shown that passive immunotherapy with immune serum or monoclonal antibodies are protective. Antiviral antibody could protect mice efficiently even if CD4+ or CD8+ T cells were depleted prior to challenge. However, in B-cell-deficient or MHC II-deficient mice, which are unable to elicit effective antibody responses, strong antiviral T-cell responses played an important role in protecting against disease following viral challenge. Studies using non-human primates infected with lethal monkeypox showed that the smallpox vaccine-induced antibody responses were both necessary and sufficient for protection against lethal monkeypox infection. In humans, cellular immunity played the most important role in protective immunity in humans against  primary poxvirus infections based on the severe complications following smallpox vaccination of children with genetic T-cell deficiencies. Following vaccination, strong antiviral antibody responses are likely to be the main effector mechanism responsible for protection against secondary infection (Amanna et al., 2006). </protective_immunity>
		<host_range refs="reference153">Variola virus is considered to be a host-restricted poxvirus, with humans as the reservoir host and no zoonotic hosts known.  However, the virus does replicate well in most mammalian cell cultures (McFadden, 2005).</host_range>
		<introduction refs="reference134">The poxviruses are a family of large, enveloped deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses. The most notorious poxvirus is variola, the causative agent of smallpox. Smallpox was an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing world until recent times. Since the host range of the variola virus is confined to humans, aggressive case identification and contact vaccination were ultimately successful in controlling the disease. The last occurrence of endemic smallpox was in Somalia in 1977, and the last human cases were laboratory-acquired infections in 1978. By 1980, the World Health Organization (WHO) General Assembly ratified the declaration of success made by the Global Commission for the Certification of Smallpox Eradication (PathPort).</introduction>

		<description refs="reference142 reference135">Dryvax supplies could be stretched by dilution. As vaccine supplies would still be insufficient, a new vaccine derived from Dryvax that is suitable for modern manufacture in cell culture at a large scale must be developed and clinically tested. The new vaccine forms the basis for the United States government's strategic vaccine stockpile for biodefense, and other countries are taking a similar course of action (Weltzin et al., 2003).
Clinical trials have been conducted using the NYCBH-derived ACAM1000 vaccinia virus-based vaccines. ACAM1000 was similar to Dryvax in its ability to induce immune responses and in reactogenicity in phase I trials (Parrino et al., 2006). </description>

			<vaccination_protocol refs="reference142">ACAM1000 for clinical testing was produced at pilot lot scale (750,000 doses) according to current Good Manufacturing Practices. A randomized, double-blind clinical study was carried out under an Investigational New Drug application approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of ACAM1000 in 60 healthy adults, without prior smallpox vaccination. On day 0, 30 eligible subjects received inoculation of ACAM1000 by 15 strokes of a bifurcated needle. The vaccine formulation contained 10^8 PFU/ml. Subjects took daily oral temperature, completed a symptom diary and returned to the clinic on days 3, 7, 10, 15, 30 and 45 and after 6 months for evaluation. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects developing a major cutaneous reaction ('take') on day 7 and/or day 10. The primary statistical method was a test of noninferiority of ACAM1000 to Dryvax intended to rule out a 20% difference in take rates. Based on a one-tailed test of noninferiority, with a significance level of 0.05 and power of 80%, and assuming that the common rate of major cutaneous reaction is 90%, 30 subjects per arm of the trial would be required to rule out an ACAM1000 rate of response of 70% or less. Secondary endpoints were neutralizing antibody and T cell responses on days 0 and 45. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were evaluated by CTL, IFN-gamma ELISPOT and lymphoproliferation assays (Weltzin et al., 2003).                                                                        </vaccination_protocol>

T-cell memory to smallpox declines slowly over time, with a half-life of 8–15 years, whereas serum antibody responses (and B-cell memory) to smallpox are maintained essentially for life with little or no observable decline.

		<description refs="reference144 reference135">The benefits of cloning appeared to outweigh the recognized risk that a clonal virus population may differ biologically from the ‘genetic swarm’ represented by the animal-skin vaccine. Because it would not be possible to conduct field tests for efficacy, the new vaccine would need to match the licensed vaccine (Dryvax®) as closely as possible in preclinical tests for safety, immunogenicity, and protective activity and in clinical trials for safety and immunogenicity ( Monath et al., 2004).
Clinical trials have been conducted using the NYCBH-derived ACAM2000 vaccinia virus-based vaccine. On the basis of animal studies, ACAM2000 is believed to be less neurovirulent than Dryvax. ACAM2000 was similar to Dryvax in its ability to induce immune responses and in reactogenicity in phase I trials. During phase II and phase III clinical trials, cases of myopericarditis were associated with both ACAM2000 and Dryvax in vaccinia-naive volunteers (Parrino et al., 2006).</description>

		<storage refs="reference771">After reconstitution, ACAM2000 vaccine may be administered within 6 to 8 hours if kept at room temperature (20-25°C, 68-77°F); it should then be discarded as a biohazardous material. Unused, reconstituted ACAM2000 vaccine may be stored in a refrigerator (2-8°C, 36-46°F) up to 30 days, after which it should be discarded as a biohazardous material (FDA: ACAM2000).</storage>
		<virulence refs="reference163 reference144 reference135">It has long been known that vaccinia strains differ with respect to neurovirulence in infant mice. Clones 1, 3, and 5 and the uncloned virus had virulence properties that were unacceptable for consideration as vaccine candidates. The same four viruses that had exhibited excessive virulence in rabbit skin were significantly more neurovirulent than Dryvax1 (p &lt; 0.05, Kaplan—Meier survival distribution, log rank test), whereas clones 2, 4, and 6 were similar to Dryvax1 or less virulent. The more virulent viruses also replicated to higher titer in mouse brain. In these initial experiments Clone 2 did not appear to be attenuated with respect to neurovirulence, but subsequent studies with larger numbers of animals showed significantly higher survival distribution compared to Dryvax1. Clone 2 (renamed ACAM1000) was selected as the candidate for further development, based on its similarity to Dryvax1 in pock formation in rabbit skin but its lower neurovirulence in mice and monkeys. Seed viruses and vaccine produced from each bioreactor run were tested for neurovirulence in suckling mice, using Dryvax1 as a comparator. Plaque-purified vaccinia virus lines were shown to differ significantly in neurovirulence for mice, in their ability to evoke immune responses against the inserted gene product, and in their HindIII restriction maps. The variant viruses often exhibit reduced infectivity and reduced virulence for mice. We found biological and molecular heterogeneity among 6 clones derived from Dryvax1, with some clonal subpopulations (e.g. Clone 3) having dramatically higher virulence and changes at the genomic level. The degree of neurovirulence for suckling mice was used to distinguish vaccine strains with low, moderate, or high pathogenicity (Vilesova et al., 1985). The new vaccine has advantages over first generation vaccines, since it has been produced to modern manufacturing and control standards, is free from adventitious agents , and does not contain subpopulations of virus with undesirable virulence properties (Monath et al., 2004).
In addition, mice immunized with MVA were protected against lethal infection with a more virulent form of vaccinia virus altered to coexpress IL-4. IL-4 diminishes the cytolytic capacity of CD81 T cells, resulting in delayed viral clearance and increased virulence (Parrino et al., 2006).                                            </virulence>

Specifically, ACAM2000 was manufactured by infecting Vero cells grown on microcarriers under serum-free conditions with the P9 production virus inoculum at an MOI of 0.01–0.2. Virus particles were purified and concentrated. The resulting concentrated bulk vaccine was formulated by dilution with a buffer containing stabilizers to a final potency of 1.0–5.0 × 10^8 pfu/mL, filled into vials containing 0.3 mL ( Monath et al., 2004).</preparation>

Subjects in the study kept a diary of adverse events and took daily oral temperatures. There were no serious adverse events. All 70 subjects (100%) experienced at least one treatment-emergent, expected adverse event during the study. The adverse events were generally mild and did not interfere with the subjects’ daily activities. One subject experienced a serious adverse event, a single new onset seizure on Day 8; this event was considered by the investigator to be remotely related to the study vaccine. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events were related to the vaccination site and associated lymphadenitis, and the majority of adverse events reported were assessed as mild or moderate in intensity. Elevated temperature was reported as an adverse event for 9 (9%) subjects. Fortunately, cardiac adverse events appear to be self-limiting (Monath et al., 2004).</side_effects>

Among the study groups, 100 volunteers were assigned to receive various dilutions of CCSV. There were no statistically significant differences between the CCSV and Dryvax groups comparing humoral and cellular immune responses and rates of adverse events.

Participants were stratified by previous exposure to vaccinia (naive vs non-naive) and randomly assigned to vaccine group with a computer-generated process. In the vaccinia-naive group, a ratio of 2 to 1 (CCSV to Dryvax) was used, whereas in the non-naive population, the ratio was 1 to 1. All cohorts were enrolled consecutively with at least a 21-day delay between vaccination of successive cohorts. Cohorts 1-3 consisted of 15, 45, and 90 vaccinia-naive individuals, respectively (100 assigned CCSV and 50 Dryvax). Cohort four consisted of 100 non-naive individuals (50 CCSV and 50 Dryvax).

In vaccinia-naive individuals, titres peaked on day 28, whereas in non-naive people, they peaked on day 14.

During clinic visits in the first 28 days, individuals were assessed for adverse events (vital signs, diary inspection, and concomitant medication) and formation of pock lesions (pock lesion inspection, measurements, and photographs). Intensity of adverse events was classified as mild (awareness of signs and symptoms that are easily tolerated), moderate (signs and symptoms produce discomfort sufficient to interfere with, but not prevent, normal daily activities), or severe (signs and symptoms produce sufficient discomfort to prevent normal daily activities). Differences between two proportions (eg, proportion with adverse events or proportion testing positive by an immunological assay). No serious vaccine-related adverse events were reported. Nobody withdrew from the study because of an adverse event. Other than rashes, no notable differences in frequency or severity of adverse events were recorded in the group receiving undiluted CCSV compared with those receiving diluted CCSV, and there were no notable differences in frequency of adverse events in the 1 in 50 group compared with those in other dilution groups. The adverse events reported for both vaccines were similar in severity and frequency, indicating that the manufacturing process in early human testing did not select for a more reactogenic vaccine, although it never entered larger clinical trials. As expected, vaccinia-non-naive participants tended to have fewer and milder adverse events than their vaccinia-naive counterparts. Overall, the adverse events in the diluted cohort were consistent with those of the other vaccinia-naive cohorts (Greenberg et al., 2005).</side_effects>

			<description refs="reference141">U.S. government organizations have identified the need for a new smallpox vaccine to replenish limited stocks of the approved calf-lymph derived vaccine. Previous manufacturing methods using calf lymph are no longer acceptable because of the absence of controls in the process and the potential risk of contamination with the infectious agent associated with the prion disease bovine spongiform encephalitis. New manufacturing methods will need to eliminate the bovine intermediary. Because of ethical and safety considerations, challenge studies or field trials cannot be done to show efficacy. The strategy in designing the cell-cultured smallpox vaccine (CCSV) entailed selection of a well characterised isolate from a master vaccine seed stock used in the WHO eradication campaign. Methods of manufacture included consistency-validated processes for all aspects of manufacture, purification, storage, and distribution. Advantages of manufacture of this vaccine include the breadth of previous experience with well defined human diploid fetal lung fibroblasts in the production of other live, viral human vaccines, and the fact that the process is free from antimicrobial compounds that could produce reactions in sensitised individuals. The aims of this phase 1 clinical trial were to assess safety (frequency and severity of local and systemic adverse events), reactogenicity (frequency and characteristics of pock lesions), and immunogenicity (humoral and cellular immunity assays) of equivalent doses of CCSV and Dryvax in both vaccinia-naive and non-naive, healthy adult volunteers. Additionally, CCSV doses up to 50 times more dilute than the recommended dose for the Dryvax were assessed in a vaccinia-naive population (Greenberg et al., 2005).</description>

In these highly screened individuals, there were fewer adverse events than anticipated on the basis of the historical data, and no cases of progressive vaccinia or eczema vaccinatum. However, a new finding of cardiac complications have become a cause for concern. Although European and Australian literature from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s reported fatal and nonfatal postvaccinial cardiac complications, such reports were rare in the United States. At the time, this difference was believed to have been related to the less reactogenic strain of vaccinia virus used in the United States. However, the findings from the military and civilian vaccination programs indicate those with cardiac disease should not receive vaccinia in nonemergent settings. Of the 38,885 civilian smallpox vaccines administered between 2002 and 2003, there were 21 cases of myopericarditis and 10 ischemic cardiac events, of which 2 were fatal. In the military program as of June 2006, there were more than 1 million vaccinations and 120 cases of myopericarditis. The 16 cases of ischemic heart disease were consistent with rates in unvaccinated military recruits of the same age. The investigation of 8 fatalities after vaccination determined 1 death from an acute lupuslike illness may have a causal relationship to vaccine. In addition, vaccination was thought possibly to contribute to the sudden death of a 26-year-old military recruit 16 days after he received smallpox and influenza vaccinations. However, autopsy revealed myocarditis with parvovirus B in the cardiac muscle and no evidence of vaccinia virus ( Parrino et al., 2006).</virulence>

The licensed full-strength smallpox vaccine containing the NYCBH strain of vaccinia was used. First-time vaccination entailed punctures with a bifurcated needle. Previous vaccinees received 15 punctures. Those who did not respond with a major reaction as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) were vaccinated again. Smallpox vaccinations began at 4 pilot sites: Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC; Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD; Wilford Hall Air Force Medical Center, Lackland Air Force Base, San Antonio, TX; and the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD.

		<virulence refs="reference146">The vaccinia virus strain NYVAC was genetically attenuated by deletion of many nonessential genes, including virulence and host range genes, resulting in a strain growing only in primary cells. Passaging in mammalian cells increases virulence in mammals, resulting in new MVA-like strains with unknown safety profiles in humans. The resulting viruses grow exclusively in a complementing permanent cell line, excluding reversion to virulence and obviating the need for primary cells. The WR strain is a vaccinia virus laboratory strain passaged in mouse brain that has unfavorable properties, such as neurovirulence and gonadotropism, not suitable for clinical use. The large deletions characteristic for MVA seemed to suggest that the restriction in host range and virulence was mainly due to these deletions, including the loss of a host range gene and many immune modulatory genes. It will be interesting to see whether an MVA strain first adapted to growth in mammalian cells and then passaged in mouse brain also regains virulence. In contrast to MVA, dVVs with an essential gene deleted cannot regain replication and virulence functions upon passaging in a chosen host. Reversion to virulence can principally be excluded because the vector lacks an essential gene, which restricts its host range to a complementing cell line (Ober et al., 2002).</virulence>

It is found in very low levels in normal cells; however, in a variety of transformed cell lines, it is expressed in high amounts and is believed to contribute to transformation and malignancy. p53 is a DNA-binding protein containing DNA-binding, oligomerization, and transcription activation domains. It is postulated to bind as a tetramer to a p53-binding site and activate expression of downstream genes that inhibit growth and/or invasion and thus function as a tumor suppressor. Mutants of p53 that frequently occur in a number of different human cancers fail to bind the consensus DNA binding site and hence cause the loss of tumor suppressor activity. Alterations of the TP53 gene occur not only as somatic mutations in human malignancies, but also as germline mutations in some cancer-prone families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (Ober et al., 2002).</description>

At 4 weeks after challenge a lesion was observed at the injection site, which subsequently healed.

Although the entry process is not well understood, a model consistent with available data is that IMV fuse directly with plasma membrane, whereas EV entry involves endocytosis, low-pH-induced disruption of the outer membrane, and fusion of the exposed IMV with the endosomal membrane. Protein subunit vaccines have been evaluated in mice (Fogg et al., 2004).
Recombinant proteins of the outer membranes of IMV and EEV forms of vaccinia virus were used individually or in combination to immunize mice before i.n. challenge with a lethal dose of the WR strain of vaccinia virus. Vaccination with the individual proteins afforded partial protection; complete protection was achieved with 3 doses of the 3-protein IMV–EEV combination vaccine (Parrino et al., 2006).</description>

The genes responsible for neurovirulence and temperature sensitivity do not seem to correlate with the B5R gene and remain to be identified. The identification of these genes will make it possible to improve the VV vectors. The neurovirulence of RVVs tended to be milder than that of the parental vaccinia viruses.

After a further 6 passages, LC16m0 was selected as a temperature-sensitive and medium pock-forming virus, and LC16m8 was cloned from the LC16m0 strain as a small pock-forming variant.

Furthermore, vaccination with a single dose of 10^8 pfu of MVA resulted in a minimal weight loss (&lt;10%), as did a vaccination combination of 10^8 pfu of MVA followed by 10^6 pfu of Dryvax. When mice that were immunized with a lower dose of 10^6 pfu of MVA were challenged with i.n. vaccinia virus WR, 4/5 survived a challenge with 10 LD50s at either 6 weeks or 12 weeks post-vaccination. When mice received a single immunization of 10^6 pfu of MVA and were challenged with 25 LD50s, 4/5 survived challenge at 6 weeks post-vaccination and 3/5 survived challenge at 12 weeks post-vaccination. In contrast, all animals receiving 10^6 MVA and boosted 6 weeks later with either 10^6 pfu of MVA or 10^6 pfu of Dryvax survived. These results indicate that combinations of MVA are as effective as Dryvax in eliciting immune responses and inducing protective immunity in a mouse model (Meseda et al., 2005).</protection_efficacy>
			<side_effects refs="reference155 reference156">A safer smallpox vaccine could benefit the millions of people that are advised not to take the current one because they or their contacts have increased susceptibility to severe vaccine side effects. Because the correlates of smallpox protection are unknown, findings of similar humoral and cellular immune responses to MVA and Dryvax in NHPs and substantial protection against a severe monkeypox virus challenge are important steps in the evaluation of MVA as a replacement vaccine for those with increased risk of severe side effects from the standard live vaccine, or as a pre-vaccine. As a result of extreme attenuation, MVA causes no adverse effects even when high doses are injected into immunedeficient NHPs. No adverse local or systemic effects were noted after vaccination with MVA. As expected, pustular skin lesions did develop after Dryvax (Earl et al., 2004).
Significant adverse events are associated with vaccination with the currently licensed smallpox vaccine. Candidate new-generation smallpox vaccines, such as MVA, produce very few adverse events in experimental animals and in limited human clinical trials conducted near the end of the smallpox eradication campaign. MVA was administered to more than 120,000 individuals in the latter stages of the smallpox eradication campaign without significant adverse events, although the thoroughness of safety data monitoring at that time is unclear. In addition to a vaccination strategy that employs multiple immunizations of MVA, alternative smallpox vaccination strategies may include an initial vaccination with non-replicating virus vaccine followed by a second immunization with a traditional replicating virus vaccine in order to reduce the possibility of vaccine-associate adverse events due to replicating vaccinia virus. Such a scheme of vaccination may be considered as a means of reducing the rate of adverse events associated with traditional smallpox vaccination, provided that vaccine efficacy is not compromised (Meseda et al., 2005).</side_effects>

In addition, vaccination protocols with Elstree-RIVM alone and vaccination with a second-generation vaccine (Elstree-BN) were evaluated. Elstree-BN is based on the same vaccinia virus strain as Elstree-RIVM, but the former was passaged and produced on chicken embryo fibroblasts to further attenuate the virus and to make a better defined vaccine preparation that does not depend on the use of calves (Stittelaar et al., 2005).</description>

Vaccination of immunocompromised macaques with the genetically-engineered, replication-deficient poxvirus NYVAC, before or after retrovirus infection, was safe and lessened the severity of Dryvax-induced skin lesions. Neutralizing antibodies to vaccinia were induced by NYVAC, even in macaques with severe CD4+ T cell depletion, and their titers inversely correlated with the time to complete resolution of the skin lesions. Together, these results provide the proof of concept, in macaque models that mirror human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 infection, that a prime-boost approach with a highly attenuated poxvirus followed by Dryvax increases the safety of smallpox vaccination, and they highlight the importance of neutralizing antibodies in protection against virulent poxvirus (Edghill-Smith et al., 2003).</description>

A similar variety and pattern of immune responses were involved in protection induced by modified vaccinia Ankara and Wyeth viruses. For both, antibody was essential to protect against disease, whereas neither effector CD4+ nor CD8+ T cells were necessary or sufficient. However, in the absence of antibody, T cells were necessary and sufficient for survival and recovery. Also, T cells played  a greater role in control of sublethal infection in unimmunized animals. These properties, shared with the existing smallpox vaccine, provide a basis for further evaluation of these replication-deficient vaccinia viruses as safer vaccines against smallpox or against complications from vaccinia virus (Belyakov et al., 2003).</description>

			<description refs="reference164">The replication competence of live vaccines, such as the only currently available smallpox vaccine, Dryvax, may pose safety concerns when injected in individuals with congenital, acquired, or iatrogenic immunodeficiency. Because the number of patients with immunodeficiency has increased worldwide as a result of the HIV-1 epidemic, the increase in the number of organ transplants, and aggressive chemotherapy in patients with cancer, the risks associated with Dryvax vaccination may affect a larger portion of the population than before. It has been hypothesized that immunization of immunocompromised individuals, with highly attenuated poxviruses, may ameliorate the clinical outcome of Dryvax vaccination. In macaques with modest to severe depletion of CD4+ T cells, it was tested whether immunization with NYVAC before or after infection with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) or simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) would increase the safety of Dryvax vaccination. NYVAC was shown to be safer in severely immunocompromised macaques and that NYVAC priming resulted in a faster resolution of Dryvax-induced lesions in both healthy and immunocompromised macaques ( Edghill-Smith et al., 2003).</description>

with VACV range from the nonserious (e.g., fever, rash, headache, pain, and fatigue) to life threatening (e.g., eczema vaccinatum, encephalitis, and progressive vaccinia). Serious adverse events that are not necessarily causally associated with vaccination, including myocarditis and/or myopericarditis, have been reported during past and present smallpox vaccination programs. Several adverse cardiac events reported in the first 4 months of the 2003 civilian and military vaccination campaigns prompted the CDC to revise their recommendations for exclusion of potential smallpox recipients to include those persons with heart disease or several other conditions. In addition, identifying protective immunogens might allow the development of a subunit smallpox vaccine that affords protection with negligible adverse events (Hooper et al., 2004).</side_effects>

Animals vaccinated with a single gene (L1R), which encodes a target of neutralizing antibodies, developed severe disease but survived.

Mice were anesthetized and weighed before i.n. injection of 50 μl of PBS containing 2 × 10^6 pfu of VACV strain IHD-J using a plastic pipette tip. After challenge, mice were observed and weighed daily for 3 weeks (Hooper et al., 2006).</vaccination_protocol>

			<side_effects refs="reference162">There are several drawbacks to the current anthrax vaccines including nonserious and serious adverse events that make the vaccine contraindicated in large segments of the population (e.g., persons who are immunodeficient, immunosuppressed, pregnant, breastfeeding, or have history of cardiac disease), and because this vaccine results in a localized skin infection containing infectious virus (i.e. pock), the infection can spread to other sites on the body (e.g. ocular autoinoculation) or to persons who come in close contact with the vaccinee. Identification of the genes associated with protective immunity and, conversely, the genes associated with adverse events unrelated to dissemination or transmission will be important for characterizing the next-generation smallpox vaccines and for engineering future smallpox vaccines (Hooper et al., 2006).</side_effects>

			<description refs="reference162">The enhanced immunogenicity of DNA vaccines delivered by gene gun likely involves the direct introduction of plasmid DNA to cells in the skin, including specialized antigen-presenting cells (APCs). While the gene gun has yielded among the most promising immune responses for a DNA vaccine thus far, there is the possibly that all of the criteria required for successful product development will not be satisfied. Hence, it is important to continue to evaluate alternative technologies that might better facilitate the development of licensed human vaccines. Alternative means of delivering DNA vaccines under investigation include the use of electric field technologies. Electroporation is a process whereby cells are transiently permeabilized by high-intensity electric field pulses. The present study tests a novel device capable of targeting electroporation to the dermis using a microneedle array. The plasmid DNA is dried onto the tips of the microneedles, which are inserted into the skin where the DNA dissolves in interstial fluid and is then transfected into the surrounding cells by electroporation (Hooper et al., 2006).</description>

H3L-immunized mice developed high-titer vaccinia virus-neutralizing antibodies (mean PRNT50 = 1:3,760). Importantly, H3L-immunized mice were subsequently protected against lethal intranasal challenges with 1 or 5 50% lethal doses (LD50) of pathogenic vaccinia virus strain WR, demonstrating the in vivo value of an anti-H3L response. To formally demonstrate that neutralizing anti-H3L antibodies are protective in vivo, we performed anti-H3L serum passive-transfer experiments. Mice receiving H3L-neutralizing antiserum were protected from a lethal challenge with 3 LD50 of vaccinia virus strain WR (5/10 versus 0/10; P &gt; 0.02) [Ref1470:Davies et al., 2005].</phi_annotation>

        <phi_annotation>It has previously been shown that a DNA subunit vaccine (4pox) based on four orthopoxvirus immunogens (L1R, B5R, A27L and A33R) can produce protective immunity against lethal orthopoxvirus challenges in mice and nonhuman primates. the immunogenicity of an L1R construct to which a tissue plasminogen activator signal sequence was placed in frame with the full-length L1R gene was tested. When the tPA-L1R construct was substituted for the unmodified L1R gene in the 4pox vaccine, given as a prime and single boost, animals were better protected from lethal challenge with vaccinia virus (VACV) [Ref1469:Golden et al., 2008].</phi_annotation>
