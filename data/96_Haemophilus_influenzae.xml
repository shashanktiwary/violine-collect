		<pathogenesis refs="reference253 reference256">The most important virulence factor defining pathogenic H. influenzae strains is capsule, of which six serotypes, a-f, have been described. Among encapsulated strains, those possessing the type b capsule (Hib strains), which is composed of polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP), are the most virulent, capable of causing sustained bacteremia and subsequent focal infection in non-immune, normal hosts. Like the capsules of other gram negative organisms, H. influenzae capsules enhance the pathogenicity of the bacteria by protecting them from phagocytosis. The strong negative charge of the polysaccharide capsules may provide electrostatic repulsion to phagocytic cells and the capsular material itself may sterically interfere with the binding of opsonizing antibodies and complement to the bacterial surface (Marrs et al., 2001).

H. influenzae pili (sometimes called fimbriae) was the first well studied adherence factors of H. influenzae. These filamentous organelles are seen by electron microscopy distributed in a peritrichous manner on the H. influenzae bacterial cell surface of isolates that hemagglutinate and adhere to buccal epithelial cells, but are absent from non-hemagglutinating and non-adherent bacteria. Generally strains isolated from invasive infections do not express pili, while those colonizing the nasopharynx more commonly do. piliated H. influenzae binds to erythrocytes possessing the Anton (AnWj) antigen. Additional studies have shown that sialic acid-containing lactosylceramides, the gangliosides GM1, GM2, GM3 and GD1a, inhibit pilus- mediated H. influenzae binding to both buccal epithelial cells and erythrocytes (Marrs et al., 2001).

Highly similar high-molecular-weight proteins (HMW1, HMW2) were first identified as H. influenzae-associated antigens by their ability to induce robust antibody responses in individuals with acute otitis media . Subsequent studies have revealed that these HMW proteins function as adherence factors and can facilitate the colonization of cultured human epithelial cells . HMW1 is a 160 kDa product of the hmw1A gene and HMW2 is a 155 kDa protein encoded by the hmw2A gene; hmw1A and hmw2A are 71% identical and 80% similar . To date the hmw genes have only been detected in nontypable strains, and a majority of HMW-positive strains retain both chromosomal loci (Marrs et al., 2001). 

Secretory IgA fulfills many protective functions on the mucosal surface; these include the neutralization of toxins, inhibition of pathogen attachment to the epithelium, and agglutination of organisms within mucus . To surmount this immunological obstacle, H. influenzae constitutively secrete IgA1 proteases which are enzymes that inactivate the predominant IgA species, IgA1, by cleaving the immunoglobulin molecule at the heavy chain hinge region, resulting in the production of two fragments (Fab and Fc). (Reinholdt et al., 1997)

H. influenzae produces a lipopolysaccharide structure that lacks an O-specific antigen and, instead, incorporates short oligosaccharide side chains onto three conserved heptoses and is thus termed lipooligosaccharide (LOS). A wide variety of glyco-modifications to the core LOS molecule have been detected and include the addition of glucose, galactose, lactose, phosphatidylcholine (ChoP), and sialic acid. This repertoire of sugars allows the organism to mimic common eukaryotic glycolipid structures, and is presumably an adaptive strategy for subverting immune defenses (Marrs et al., 2001).</pathogenesis>
		<disease_name>Meningitis</disease_name>
		<protective_immunity refs="reference255">Newborns are protected by transplacental maternal type b antibodies and older children and adults are protected by &quot;natural antibodies&quot;, which are H. influenzae specific antibodies in a host who has not had a known H. influenzae infection. Most likely these antibodies result from subclinical infection or asymptomatic colonization (Talan et al., 1999).</protective_immunity>
		<host_range refs="reference253">H. influenzae live exclusively in humans, and although they may cause disease in a variety of body sites (such as the central nervous system, joints, skin, lungs, bronchi and genito-urinary tract), they are most commonly isolated from the nasopharynx, where they are carried asymptomatically . Throat or nasopharyngeal culture surveys of both healthy and ill individuals reveal the carriage rate to be between 20 and 85%, and the majority of colonizing strains lack a capsule. Person to person transmission of H. influenzae is assumed to occur by contact with infected respiratory droplets and has resulted in clusters of H. influenzae type b (Hib) invasive infections among children in households and day care centers (Marrs et al., 2001).

The infant rat model of invasive Hib disease played a substantial role in the identification of Hib virulence factors. The model allows for respiratory tract colonization in rats less than three weeks of age by inhalation of only a few organisms. Colonization is followed closely by bacteremia and meningitis. Therefore, this model mimics the invasive disease seen in children . Older rats (up to three months of age) can also develop meningitis through intraperitoneal injection of Hib and subsequent bacteremia. Rabbits have also been used for experimental Hib infections and have contributed to understanding the pathophysiology of meningitis and in the design of treatment regiments. Rabbits require direct inoculation into the CNS or the perturbation of the CNS prior to i.v. injection (Marrs et al., 2001).

Experimental infection studies for otitis media most often employ the chinchilla but the gerbil and rat have also been used . In the chinchilla, NTHi are often inoculated directly into the bulla and disease is monitored over a two- to eight-week period for fluid pressure changes using otoscopy and tympanometry. Tympanocentesis and nasopharyngeal lavage are performed to assess colonization and immune responses present in the middle ear . Direct inoculation of the middle ear results in 100% infectivity but bacterial and host factors involved in initial nasopharyngeal colonization cannot be studied through this route. While NTHi can colonize the nasopharynx of chinchillas after experimental inoculation, colonization does not consistently lead to otitis media. An otitis media model has, however, been developed that allows for initial colonization with NTHi. Chinchillas are first infected with adenovirus, and then NTHi, administered nasally, will colonize the nasopharynx and sometimes result in otitis media. This scenario mimics development of otitis media in children. This method has been used to assess the role of bacterial components in colonization and their potential as vaccine candidates .

Pulmonary infection models used for vaccine efficacy tests have utilized both mice and rats. In these models, animals are immunized intravenously or at the mucosal surface and then challenged by direct administration of NTHi to the lungs. Bacterial clearance is then assessed a few hours after challenge by culturing homogenized lung tissue or lavage fluid. These pulmonary clearance models, however, do not allow for the study of persistent colonization as is seen with chronic infections in the lungs of adults with COPD. Attempts have been made to reflect this scenario in rats by administering NTHi encapsulated within agarose beads. This method can lead to infections that persist for weeks resulting in pathology and immune responses that parallel those seen in humans .</host_range>
		<introduction refs="reference254 reference434 reference253">Haemophilus influenzae are Gram negative, pleomorphic rods first described by Pfeiffer in 1892. Haemophilus influenzae includes six encapsulated types, a through f, as well as nonencapsulated or untypeable strains, and these are found as both respiratory tract commensals and respiratory and invasive pathogens (Kilian et al, 1991) (Tristram et al., 2007). Invasive H. influenzae infections, such as bacteremia, meningitis, pneumonia in children, epiglottis, and septic arthritis, are usually caused by H. influenzae strains possessing the type b capsule. Furthermore, these infections occur much more frequently in non-immune children between ages 2 months and 5 years, and this age-related susceptibility is inversely correlated with the bactericidal capacity of the blood , which is mediated by antibodies directed against the type b capsule.Although non-typable H. influenzae rarely cause invasive infections in normal hosts, they are important causes of respiratory infections, such as bronchitis and pneumonia in adults with underlying pulmonary disease  and otitis media and sinusitis in healthy individuals. Recent studies show that H. influenzae cause 23-27% of acute otitis media in children, the same incidence as S. pneumoniae (Marrs et al., 2001). Prior to introduction of Hib vaccines, Hib was estimated to be responsible worldwide for some three million serious illnesses and an estimated 386,000 deaths per year, chiefly through meningitis and pneumonia, with 95% of cases and 98% of deaths occurring in patients in developing countries. Almost all victims are children under the age of 5 years, with those between 4 and 18 months of age especially vulnerable . Large, population-based disease burden studies showed annual rates of Hib meningitis at 10 to 60 cases per 100,000 children under 5 years of age in countries where Hib vaccine is not used . In developing countries, where the vast majority of Hib deaths occur, pneumonia accounts for a larger number of deaths than meningitis. However, Hib meningitis is also a serious problem in such countries with mortality rates several times higher than seen in developed countries, and 15 to 35% of survivors have permanent disabilities such as mental retardation or deafness. Systematic vaccination has virtually eliminated Hib disease in most industrialized nations, with 89 countries offering infant immunization against Hib by the end of 2004 compared with 38 in 1999. However, Hib vaccine is not available in Japan. Ninety-two percent of the populations of developed countries were vaccinated against Hib as of 2003, while vaccination coverage was 42% for developing countries and 8% for least-developed countries (Tristram et al., 2007).</introduction>

		<description refs="reference257"> ActHIB vaccine was among the first conjugated Hib vaccines developed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). It is now manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur SA in Lyon, France. The conjugation process changes the polysaccharide from a “T-cell–independent antigen” to a “T-cell–dependent antigen”, which greatly improves immunogenicity, particularly in young children. In addition, repeated doses elicit a substantial booster response in children who have been previously vaccinated (ActHIB 2005). </description>

		<preparation refs="reference257">The vaccine consists of the Haemophilus b capsular polysaccharide (polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate, PRP), a high molecular weight polymer prepared from the Haemophilus influenzae type b (HiB) strain 1482 grown in a semi-synthetic medium, covalently bound to tetanus toxoid. The tetanus toxoid is prepared by extraction, ammonium sulfate purification, and formalin inactivation of the toxin from cultures of Clostridium tetani (Harvard strain) grown in a modified Mueller and Miller medium. The toxoid is filter sterilized prior to the conjugation process. When ActHIB vaccine is reconstituted with saline diluent, each single dose of 0.5 mL is formulated to contain 10 μg of purified capsular polysaccharide conjugated to 24 μg of inactivated tetanus toxoid, and 8.5% of sucrose (ActHIB 2005). </preparation>

			<vaccination_protocol refs="reference257">ActHIB vaccine is indicated for active immunization of infants and children 2 through 18 months of age for the prevention of invasive disease caused by H influenzae type b. 

The number of doses of ActHIB vaccine indicated depends on the age at which immunization is begun. For previously unvaccinated children, the first, second, third and fourth dose were given at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 18 months.   A child 7 to 11 months of age should receive 2 doses at 8-week intervals and a booster dose at 15 to 18 months. A child 12 to 24 months of age should receive 1 dose and a booster dose 2 months later. Preterm infants should be vaccinated according to their chronological age from birth (ActHIB 2005).

ActHIB vaccine reconstituted with the saline diluent (0.5 mL per dose) should be administered intramuscularly in the outer aspect of the midthigh or deltoid.  Do not inject intravenously. It should not be injected into the gluteal area or areas where there may be a nerve trunk. When administering multiple vaccines during a single visit, separate injection sites and syringes should be used. Administer ActHIB vaccine within 24 hours after reconstitution (ActHIB 2005).</vaccination_protocol>

Consistently high rates of seroconversion (83% to 99%) with an ActHIB vaccine 3-dose primary series were also obtained in 11 non-comparative clinical trials (N=1225) (Fritzell et al., 1992). Additionally, three NIH trials demonstrated that ActHIB vaccine produced consistently high geometric mean anti-PRP antibody titers (Decker et al., 1992).</protection_efficacy>

Other side effects may occur. ActHIB vaccine should not be given to children who have had a serious allergic reaction (anaphylactic reaction) after a previous dose of the vaccine. When administering an intramuscular injection, like ActHIB vaccine, to people with bleeding disorders, caution should be exercised because they may develop a serious bruise or collection of blood at the injection site (ActHIB 2005).</side_effects>

DNA samples were sequenced on an ABI model 373A DNA sequencer with dye terminator chemistry.  Plasmid JB-1042-5-1 contains the entire SB33 d15 gene (see Fig. 4). The ;2.9-kb HindIII-EcoRI d15 gene fragment was subcloned into pUC8-BgXb to generate plasmid pRY-60-1. Digestion of pRY- 60-1 with BsrFI and EcoRI excised a ;2.7-kb fragment containing most of the coding sequence of d15. The remainder of the DNA sequences coding for the amino terminus of D15 were recreated from ;90-bp NdeI-BsrFI oligonucleotides (Loosmore et al., 1997).</description>

		<description refs="reference267">Linkage of Haemophilus b saccharides to a protein such as CRM197 converts the saccharide (HbO) to a T-dependent (HbOC) antigen, and results in an enhanced antibody response to the saccharide in young infants that primes for an anamnestic response and is predominantly of the IgG class.12 Laboratory evidence indicates that the native state of the CRM197 protein and the use of oligosaccharides in the formulation of HibTITER enhances its immunogenicity (Weinberg et al., 1988). 
In most cases HibTITER was administered concomitantly with other vaccines including DTP, DTaP, hepatitis B vaccine, IPV, OPV, pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine, MMR, and/or meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine (not licensed in the US).</description>

		<preparation refs="reference266">The oligosaccharides are derived from highly purified capsular polysaccharide, polyribosylribitol phosphate, isolated from Haemophilus b strain Eagan grown in a chemically defined medium (a mixture of mineral salts, amino acids, and cofactors). The oligosaccharides are purified and sized by diafiltrations through a series of ultrafiltration membranes, and coupled by reductive amination directly to highly purified CRM197. CRM197 is a nontoxic variant of diphtheria toxin isolated from cultures of Corynebacterium diphtheriae C7 (β197) grown in a casamino acids and yeast extract-based medium that is ultrafiltered before use. CRM197 is purified through ultrafiltration, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and ion-exchange chromatography to high purity. The conjugate is purified to remove unreacted protein, oligosaccharides, and reagents; sterilized by filtration; and filled into vials (HibTITER 2007). The vaccine is a clear, colorless solution.

For infants 2 to 6 months of age, the immunizing dose is three separate injections of 0.5 mL given at approximately 2-month intervals. Previously unvaccinated infants 12 from 7 through 11 months of age should receive two separate injections approximately 2 months apart. Children from 12 through 14 months of age who have not been vaccinated previously receive one injection. All vaccinated children receive a single booster dose at 15 months of age or older, but not less than 2 months after the previous dose. Previously unvaccinated children 15 to 71 months of age receive a single injection of HibTITER. Preterm infants should be vaccinated with HibTITER according to their chronological age, from birth (AAPC 1991).

Data support that HibTITER may be interchanged with other Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccines for the primary immunization series and booster dose.

Children 7 to 11 and 12 to 14 months of age received 2 doses at the same interval.Children 15 to 23 months of age received a single dose. HibTITER was highly immunogenic in all age groups studied, with 97% to 100% of 1,232 infants attaining titers of ≥ 1 μg/mL and 92% to 100% for bactericidal activity (HibTITER 2007).

Postlicensure surveillance of immunogenicity was conducted during the distribution of the first 30 million doses of HibTITER and during the time period over which Haemophilus b disease in children has been decreasing significantly in areas of extensive vaccine usage.After three doses, titers ranged from 2.37 to 8.45 μg/mL with 67% to 94% attaining ≥ 1 μg/mL (HibTITER 2007).

A comparative clinical trial was performed in Finland where approximately 53,000 infants received HibTITER at 4 and 6 months of age and a booster dose at 14 months in a trial conducted from January 1988 through December 1990. Only two children developed Haemophilus b disease after receiving the two-dose primary immunization schedule. One child became ill at 15 months of age and the other at 18 months of age; neither child received the scheduled booster at 14 months of age. No vaccine failure has been reported in children who received the two-dose primary series and the booster dose at 14 months of age. Based on more than 32,000 person-years of follow-up time, the estimate of efficacy is about 95% when compared to historical control groups followed between 1985 and 1988.20 Historical controls were used since all infants received one of two Haemophilus b conjugate vaccines during the period of the trial (HibTITER 2007).</protection_efficacy>

Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae is of particular importance because it is the most commonly isolated bacterium at times of exacerbation (Foxwell et al., 2006).

No patient was taking corticosteroids or mmunosuppressive agents, but many took bronchodilator drugs and antibiotics. Three groups were tested: one took enteric-coated glucose tablets; the second took enteric-coated tablets containing 25 mg sodium tauroglycocholate; while the third took enteric-coated tablets each containing 10th power of killed H influenzae with sodium tauroglycocholate. Three courses of tablets were given at 0, 28, and 56 days. Each course consisted of two tablets taken before breakfast each day for 3 consecutive days.

An adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH, Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, WI) was then bound covalently to the dLOS to form an adipic hydrazide derivative, AH-dLOS. P6 was isolated from strain 9274 (Wu et al., 2005). P6 was covalently conjugated to dLOS of strain 9274 through adipic acid dihydrazide with different ratios of dLOS to P6. It resulted in two conjugate formulations with weight ratios of dLOS to P6 of 3.7 for dLOS–P6 (I) and 1.6 for dLOS–P6 (II). Binding activity of the conjugates was examined by ELISA with mouse monoclonal antibodies specific to LOS and P6 and a rabbit anti-P6 serum. The results showed that the conjugates bound not only to the LOS antibody but also to both P6 antibodies. It suggested that the conjugates retained epitopes of both LOS and P6 antigens (Wu et al., 2005).</preparation>

The immunodominant exposed surface molecules of NTHi, including lipooligosaccharide (LOS) and outer membrane proteins, are extremely variable antigenically  and infection with one strain provides immunity only to that strain. Thus, NTHi vaccine efforts have focused on antigenically conserved outer membrane protein such as the P4 and P6 proteins and LOS-conjugates. While the surface of M. catarrhalis appears to be much less antigenically variable, vaccine efforts have also focused on conserved outer membrane proteins and LOS. The ubiquitous cell surface protein A (UspA) of M. catarrhalis is a particularly interesting vaccine candidate (Mason et al., 2004).</description>

While rTbpB-specific antibodies from immunized rats were nonspecific in the recognition of TbpB from six heterologous NTHI strains on Western blots, these antibodies differed in their ability to block transferrin binding to heterologous strains and to cross-react in bactericidal assays (Webb et al., 1999).</protection_efficacy>

		<description refs="reference260 reference261">PedvaxHIB is a highly purified capsular polysaccharide (polyribosylribitol phosphate or PRP) of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Haemophilus b, Ross strain) that is covalently bound to an outer membrane protein complex (OMPC) of the B11 strain of Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B. The covalent bonding of the PRP to the OMPC which is necessary for enhanced immunogenicity of the PRP is confirmed by quantitative analysis of the conjugate’s components following chemical treatment which yields a unique amino acid (PedvasHIB).

Nonconjugated PRP vaccines are capable of stimulating B-lymphocytes to produce antibody without the help of T-lymphocytes (T-independent). The responses to many other antigens are augmented by helper T-lymphocytes (T-dependent). PedvaxHIB is a PRP-conjugate vaccine in which the PRP is covalently bound to the OMPC carrier29 producing an antigen which is postulated to convert the T-independent antigen (PRP alone) into a T-dependent antigen resulting in both an enhanced antibody response and immunologic memory (Marburg 1986).</description>

			<vaccination_protocol refs="reference260">Liquid PedvaxHIB is indicated for routine vaccination against invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b in infants and children 2 to 71 months of age. Liquid PedvaxHIB is ready to use and does not require a diluent. Each 0.5 mL dose of Liquid PedvaxHIB is a sterile product formulated to contain: 7.5 mcg of Haemophilus b PRP, 125 mcg of Neisseria meningitidis OMPC and 225 mcg of aluminum as amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate (previously referred to as aluminum hydroxide), in 0.9% sodium chloride, but does not contain lactose or thimerosal.

Infants 2 to 14 months of age should receive a 0.5 mL dose of vaccine ideally beginning at 2 months of age followed by a 0.5 mL dose 2 months later (or as soon as possible thereafter). When the primary two-dose regimen is completed before 12 months of age, a booster dose is required . Infants born prematurely, regardless of birth weight, should be vaccinated at the same chronological age and according to the same schedule and precautions as full-term infants and children.

Children 15 months of age and older previously unvaccinated against Hib disease should receive a single 0.5 mL dose of vaccine.

In infants completing the primary two-dose regimen before 12 months of age, a booster dose (0.5 mL) should be administered at 12 to 15 months of age, but not earlier than 2 months after the second dose (PedvasHIB).</vaccination_protocol>
			<persistence refs="">A booster dose of PedvaxHIB is required in infants who complete the primary two-dose regimen before 12 months of age. This booster dose will help maintain antibody levels during the first two years of life when children are at highest risk for invasive Hib disease.</persistence>

			<immune_response_type refs=""></immune_response_type>
			<protection_efficacy refs="reference260"> PedvaxHIB was initially evaluated in 3,486 Native American (Navajo) infants, who completed the primary two-dose regimen in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (The Protective Efficacy Study). Each infant in this study received two doses of either placebo or lyophilized PedvaxHIB with the first dose administered at a mean of 8 weeks of age and the second administered approximately two months later. Following the primary two-dose regimen, the protective efficacy of lyophilized PedvaxHIB was calculated to be 93% with a 95% confidence interval of 57%-98% (p=0.001, twotailed).All original participants were then followed two years and nine months from termination of the study. Efficacy for this follow-up period, estimated from persondays at risk, was 96.6% (95 C.I., 72.2-99.9%) in children under 18 months of age and 100% (95 C.I., 23.5-100%) in children over 18 months of age (PedvasHIB).

Lyophilized PedvaxHIB induced antibody levels greater than 1.0 mcg/mL in children who were poor responders to nonconjugated PRP vaccines (PedvasHIB). In addition, lyophilized PedvaxHIB has been studied in children at high risk of Hib disease because of genetically-related deficiencies [Blacks who were Km(1) allotype negative and Caucasians who were G2m(23) allotype negative] and are considered hyporesponsive to nonconjugated PRP vaccines on this basis. The hyporesponsive children had anti-PRP responses comparable to those of allotype positive children of similar age range when vaccinated
with lyophilized PedvaxHIB. All children achieved anti-PRP levels of &gt;1.0 mcg/mL (PedvasHIB).</protection_efficacy>
			<side_effects refs="reference260 reference262">The most frequently reported (&gt;1%) adverse reactions, in decreasing order of frequency, were irritability, sleepiness, injection site pain/soreness, injection site erythema (≤2.5 cm diameter), injection site swelling/induration, unusual high-pitched crying, prolonged crying (&gt;4 hr), diarrhea, vomiting, crying, pain, otitis media, rash, and upper respiratory infection (PedvasHIB).

The use of Haemophilus b Polysaccharide Vaccines and another Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine has been associated with the following additional adverse effects: early onset Hib disease and Guillain-Barré syndrome (Meekison et al., 1989).</side_effects>

        <phi_annotation>When chinchillas were immunized with recombinant P1 (rP1) obtained from one of these isolates (BCH-3), all animals developed antibodies specific for rP1. Immunized animals were protected against disease when challenged with BCH-3, but not with an ompP1 mutant of BCH-3 or a strain (BCH-2) possessing a heterologous P1 (91% identity). We conclude that (i) while P1 induces protection against NTHI-mediated otitis media, development of a polyvalent vaccine reflecting the variability of P1 would be necessary to construct an efficacious vaccine [Ref371:Bolduc et al., 2000].</phi_annotation>

        <phi_annotation>Recombinant P6 (pal) was capable of eliciting a protective antibody response against live H. influenzae type b challenge in a modified infant rat model of bacteremia [Ref1001:Yang et al., 1997].
These data demonstrate that active immunization with P6 results in the production of NTHi-specific bactericidal antibody in the chinchilla and also affords a reduction in the incidence of NTHi-induced OM [Ref5090:DeMaria et al., 1996].</phi_annotation>
