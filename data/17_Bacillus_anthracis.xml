		<pathogenesis refs="reference15 reference16">In general, spores are phagocytosed by macrophages and germinate within phagolysosomes. Vegetative bacteria release many toxins leading to macrophage death. Lethal toxin acts on host macrophages and induces the release of proinflammatory cytokines responsible for inducing sudden and fatal shock (Hanna et al., 1999). Edema toxin causes localized edema and systemic shock (Hirsh et al, 2004). Other virulence factors allow for survival within phagolysosomes and on mucosal surfaces (Inh and MprF), escape from phagolysosomes and phagocytic cells (anthrolysins), iron acquiring products (Dlp), and regulation of cellular products (AtxA and AcpA) (Hirsh et al, 2004).</pathogenesis>
		<disease_name>Anthrax</disease_name>
		<protective_immunity refs="reference181 reference19">Since protection against anthrax is induced by vaccines containing PA as the major immunogen, with minor amounts of EF and LF, antibodies against PA and other toxin components are essential in the protection against anthrax. Serum therapy has been used in the past for the treatment of human anthrax with some success. PA is a key immunogen for antianthrax vaccine development since it induces the production of toxin-neutralizing Abs. However, vital, anti-PA Abs are not the only, or completely sufficient, means for an immune host to impede the development of anthrax (Glomski et al., 2007). Immune serum containing antibodies to PA can be effective in the therapy of established experimental infection in guinea pigs. However, The identification of anti-toxic immunity as the most important means for protection against B. anthracis has been complicated by lack of an entirely well-accepted animal model for evaluating immunity to LeTx and to spores of different anthrax isolates, due to varying susceptibility of animal models to spores of different origin  (Brey, 2005). 

Anti-capsule antibodies may also be important in controlling the outgrowth phase of anthrax infection, since they would be presumed to fix complement and kill vegetative cells. However, antibodies to the poly γ-d-glutamate capsule have not been well studied, because the capsule is poorly immunogenic and is a T cell-independent antigen. Recently, a series of murine monoclonal antibodies to the capsule has been obtained by immunizing mice with an anthrax capsule isoform isolated from B. licheniformis. The capsule is a major virulence factor in mice. Although there is a definitive role for anti-toxin antibodies in protection against anthrax, it is not yet clear what levels of antibodies will be required to protect humans against anthrax after vaccination or passive injection of protective antibodies. This consideration is important since challenge studies cannot be performed in humans, and correlates of immunity have to be extrapolated from animal studies (Brey, 2005). 

Humoral immunity does not protect from nontoxinogenic capsulated bacteria; however, a cellular immune response by IFN-{gamma}-producing CD4 T lymphocytes protect mice. These results provide evidence of protective cellular immunity against capsulated B. anthracis and suggest that future antianthrax vaccines should strive to augment cellular adaptive immunity (Glomski et al., 2007).</protective_immunity>
		<host_range refs="reference115">Host ranges include the following:  livestock or other herbivores (eg, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, bison, water buffalo) acquire infection by consuming contaminated soil or feed; spores are infectious agents that can enter the human body through skin lesions, ingestion, or inhalation; and laboratory animal models include Guinea pigs, Syrian hamsters, and various mouse models (PathPort).</host_range>
		<introduction refs="reference19">The pathology of anthrax is almost entirely mediated by expression of two secreted toxins: lethal toxin (LeTx) and edema toxin (EdTx). The natural form of anthrax is extremely rare in the United States, with only 244 cases reported between 1944 and 1999. Natural infection of humans occurs through direct exposure to spores from infected animals or their products, such as hides or wool. Anthrax is primarily a disease of animals and is probably propagated in the environment through spores present in soil at sites of infected carcasses. The causative agent of anthrax is B. anthracis, which produces transmissible and infectious spores. The vegetative anthrax bacillus is not readily transmissible, but the spores are environmentally robust for years and can be easily transmitted to humans. This phenomenon is the core of anthrax biowarfare and bioterrorism concern, since infective spores can be obtained from fermentation cultures and purified in large quantities in a pure non-aggregable form suitable for aerosol dissemination. This could potentially result in the intentional dissemination of spores to cause human infection (Brey, 2005).</introduction>

The study tested 4 of the10 strains used from the earlier study challenging their guinea pigs.  In total 9 of 27 isolates tested were found to be resistant to immunization with the PA vaccine. Vaccination of guinea pigs with Sterne strain spores appears to provide broad protection against i.m. challenge with various anthrax isolates.  A dose-response curve of the Sterne spore vaccine was obtained by injecting guinea pigs with 0.5 ml i.m. in a single dose or as two doses 14 days apart.

			<vaccination_protocol refs="reference37">In the first experiment, rhesus macaques were immunized at 0 and 6 weeks with 0.5 ml of AVA plus 250 μg of an equimolar mixture of 3 CpG ODN, and then challenged with 105 Sterne strain anthrax spores when serum anti-PA titers returned to baseline at week 26. 
In the second experiment, macaques were immunized with 0.5 ml of AVA plus 500 ug of ODN 7909 or the above mixture of 3 CpG ODN ( Klinman et al., 2004).</vaccination_protocol>
			<persistence refs="reference37">The results show that co-administering CpG ODN with AVA generates high levels of toxin neutralizing antibodies very rapidly, exceeding AVA alone by 17-fold at 11 days post-immunization  (Klinman et al., 2004). </persistence>

			<description refs="reference37">Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing immunostimulatory CpG motifs can improve the immune response to co-administered antigens. In mice, CpG ODN have been shown to boost the protective efficacy of vaccines against bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens. However, due to evolutionary divergence in CpG recognition between species, ODNs that are highly active in rodents may be less efficacious in primates. Thus, pre-clinical studies to examine whether CpG ODN can accelerate and boost the immune response elictied by AVA must be conducted in a pertinent primate model. This study shows that co-administering GMP-grade CpG ODN with AVA to rhesus macaques does indeed increase rapidity, titer, affinity, and protective efficacy of their resultant IgG anti-PA response  (Klinman et al., 2004).</description>

		<description refs="reference26">Anthrax involves a dual process of bacterial replication and toxin production. The dually active anthrax vaccine (DAAV) confers simultaneous protection against both bacilli and toxins was highly sought after through research. The weakly immunogenic and antiphagocytic PGA capsule disguises the bacilli from immune surveillance in a similar manner to the role of capsular polysaccharides in protecting pathogens, such as pneumococci and meningococci. Encapsulated B. anthracis strains grow unimpeded in the infected host, whereas isolates lacking the capsule are phagocytized and are virtually avirulent. Anthrax toxins are formed by PA, lethal factor (LF), and edema factor (EF), which are secreted separately as nontoxic monomers. The binding of LF or EF to PA results in the formation of active lethal toxin (LT) or edema toxin (ET), respectively. Because of its ability to elicit a protective immune response against both anthrax toxins, PA is the target antigen of existing anthrax vaccine. However, a vaccine based on both PGA and PA might allow direct targeting of bacillar growth, as well as inhibiting toxin activity, making it more effective than a vaccine based on PA alone. PGA is an attractive antigen because it consists of d-glutamic acid residues linked by γ peptide bonds, and thus bears no resemblance to mammalian host molecules ( Rhie et al., 2003).</description>

Of the 5 vaccinated rabbits that survived, 2 were immunized i.m. with DNA followed with a protein boost and 3 were immunized subcutaneously (s.q.) with recombinant protein. DNA prime-boosted animals mount a protective response against aerosol challenge more than 1 year following the final immunization. Priming immunizations with plasmid DNA appear to set up a substantial memory response which is recalled upon protein boosting. A major factor predicting survival was the ability of the animal to mount a lasting antibody response to PA ( Galloway et al., 2004).</description>

		<description refs="reference21">Domain 4 contains the dominant protective epitopes of PA and comprises amino acids 596-735 of the carboxy terminus of the PA polypeptide.  Cell intoxication is thought to occur when full-length PA (PA83) binds to the cell surface receptor via domain 4, which contains the host cell receptor binding site.  After binding to the host cell receptor, the N-terminal amino acids (1-167, i.e. domain 1a) of domain 1, which contains a furin protease cleavage site, are cleaved off, exposing the LF or EF binding site located in domain 1b and the adjacent domain 3.  Domains 2 and 3 then form part of a heptameric pore on the cell surface, the LF or EF binds to its receptor, and the whole toxin complex undergoes receptor-mediated endocytosis into the cell.  After acidification of the endosome, the toxin is translocates into the cell cytosol, where it exerts its cytotoxic effect.  Therefore, inhibition of the binding and entry of the toxin complex, particularly lethal toxin, into the host cell is clearly important for the prevention of infection.  The crystal structure of PA shows domain 4 to be more exposed than the other three domains, which are closely associated with each other.  This structural arrangement may make the epitopes in domain 4 the most prominent for recognition by immune effector cells (Flick-Smith et al., 2002).</description>

        <protein_annotation>Protective antigen (PA) is the dominant antigen in both natural and vaccine-induced immunity to anthrax infection and consists of four distinct and functionally independent domains.  Domain 1 is divided into domains 1a (consisting of amino acids 1-167) and 1b (consisting of aa 168-258).  Domain 2 comprises aa 259-487 and domain 3 aa 488-595.  After the antigen binds to the host cell receptor via the binding site of domain 4, the N-terminal amino acids (1-167, i.e. domain 1a) of domain 1, which contain a furin protease cleavage site, are cleaved off, exposing the LF or EF binding site located in domain 1b and the adjacent domain 3.  Domains 2 and 3 then form part of a heptameric pore on the cell surface, the LF or EF binds to its receptor, and the whole toxin complex undergoes receptor-mediated endocytosis into the cell.  After acidification of the endosome, the toxin is translocated into the cell cytosol where it exerts its cytotoxic effect.  Therefore, inhibition of the binding and entry of the toxin complex, particularly lethal toxin, into the host cell is clearly important for the prevention of infection [Ref21:Flick-Smith et al., 2002].</protein_annotation>
